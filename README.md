# Days of the week


#### Task 
----

Create a solution that, when given a string "day" representing the day of the week, and an integer "dayIncrement", it should return the day of the week that is "dayIncrement" days later. 


## Implementation Considerations

Consider that:

* Days are supplied and should be represented as three letter strings
* The dayIncrement value can be between [0....500]
